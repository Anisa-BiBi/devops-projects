##### Static Site Server
https://roadmap.sh/projects/static-site-server
Setup a basic linux server and configure it to serve a static site.

The goal of this project is to help you understand the basics of setting up a web server using a basic static site served using Nginx. You will also learn how to use rsync to deploy your changes to the server.

##### Requirements
Here are the requirements for this project:

ðŸ§© Register and setup a remote linux server on any provider e.g. a simple droplet on DigitalOcean which     gives you $200 in free credits with the link. Alternatively, use AWS or any other provider.
ðŸ§© Make sure that you can connect to your server using SSH.
ðŸ§© Install and configure nginx to serve a static site.
ðŸ§© Create a simple webpage with basic HTML, CSS and image files.
ðŸ§© Use "rsync" to update a remote server with a local static site.
ðŸ§© If you have a domain name, point it to your server and serve your static site from there. Alternatively, set up your nginx server to serve the static site from the serverâ€™s IP address.

You can write a script deploy.sh which when you run will use rsync to sync your static site to the server.
##### Outcome:
Once you have completed the project, you should have a basic understanding of how to setup a web server using a basic static site served using Nginx. You should also have a basic understanding of how to use rsync to deploy your changes to the server.

##### Solution:
Launch two instances >>> 1. linux server 2. ubuntu client 
I am using Amazon Linux on AWS as the server and Ubuntu as the client machine (because my local machine don't support rsync) and my static site (weather app) is already in a GitHub repository.

âœ… Step 1: Prepare Ubuntu Client (My Local Machine)
   This machine will:
   1. Clone the GitHub repo (weather app)
   2. Use rsync to deploy files to AWS server

   + git clone https://github.com/Anisa-BiBi/weather-application.git
   + cd wearther-app

âœ… Step 2: Prepare AWS EC2 Server (Amazon Linux)
   Assuming youâ€™ve already launched your EC2 instance with Amazon Linux:

   2.1 Make sure NGINX is installed
      + sudo yum update -y
      + sudo amazon-linux-extras enable nginx1
      + sudo yum install nginx -y
   2.2 Start and Enable NGINX
      + sudo systemctl start nginx
      + sudo systemctl enable nginx
   2.3 Test NGINX
      Open your browser and go to:
      http://<your-ec2-public-ip>
      You should see the default NGINX welcome page.

âœ… Step 3: On Server(Amazon Linux) Setup Directory to Serve Your Site
   3.1 Choose a location (e.g., /var/www/weather) and create directory the will host your site files:
      + sudo mkdir -p /var/www/weather-app
      + sudo chown ec2-user:ec2-user /var/www/weather-app
   3.2 Configure NGINX to Serve Static Files
      Edit default NGINX config:
      + vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      + Under server { ... }, >> update the location / block:>> 
      location / {
         root /var/www/weather-app;
         index index.html;
      }
      Then restart NGINX:
      + systemctl restart nginx

âœ… Step 4: Prepare for rsync Deployment
   4.1 Place .pem File on Ubuntu
      Yes â€” your AWS .pem file (private key) should be on the Ubuntu client machine since youâ€™ll be running rsync from Ubuntu to Amazon linux on AWS.
      >> Copy your .pem file to Ubuntu (e.g., weather-key.pem)
      Set correct permissions:
      + nchmod 400 weather-key.pem
âœ… Step 5: Use rsync to Deploy Static Files
Assuming youâ€™re in your repo directory (weather-app/) on Ubuntu and your Amazon linux EC2 username is ec2-user:
      + rsync -avz -e "ssh -i weather-key.pem" ./ ec2-user@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:/var/www/weather-app

âœ… Optional: Create deploy.sh Script
   In your repo, create a file named deploy.sh:
      #!/bin/bash
      rsync -avz -e "ssh -i weather-key.pem" ./ ec2-user@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:/var/www/weather
   Make it executable:
      + chmod +x deploy.sh
   Then you can deploy by running:
      + ./deploy.sh
âœ… Final Result
   Visit http://<EC2-PUB-IP> in browser
   My weather app should be running
